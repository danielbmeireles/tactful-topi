### Tactful Topi: A Playful Tribute to Ubuntu Naming

The name "Tactful Topi" is a light-hearted nod to the unique naming convention Ubuntu uses for its releases: combining an adjective with the name of an African animal, both with the same first letter (e.g., "Warty Warthog," "Precise Pangolin"). Here, "Tactful" means showing sensitivity and thoughtfulness—qualities we might wish for our code editor to embody! Meanwhile, the "Topi" is a type of antelope found in Africa, known for its sleek appearance and swift movements.

This fun combination reflects both functionality and style, aiming to bring a touch of wit and Ubuntu-inspired flair to your Visual Studio Code environment. It’s more than a color theme; it’s a tribute to the creativity of open-source communities!
